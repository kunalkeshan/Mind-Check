Mind Check is a web application designed to help individuals assess and track their mental well-being. It provides users with a series of tests to evaluate various aspects of their mental health and provides personalized feedback based on the test results.

## Features

- **Free Test and Feedback**: Mind Check offers a collection of mental health tests that users can take for free. After completing a test, users receive personalized feedback based on their responses.

- **User Accounts**: Users have the option to create an account to store their test data and access additional features. Creating an account allows users to view their test history, track their progress over time, and receive recommendations for improving their mental well-being.

- **Secure Data Storage**: Mind Check utilizes Firebase, a cloud-based platform, for secure data storage and authentication. User data, including test results and personal information, is encrypted and protected.

- **Curated Resources**: A treasure trove of articles and blogs, personalized to your mental health test results. Unlock valuable insights, strategies, and self-care tips, empowering you to thrive on your emotional well-being journey. Written in Markdown and rendered in JSX.

- **AI-powered Feedback**: (Coming Soon!) The application leverages AI algorithms to provide customized feedback based on the user's test inputs. This feedback is designed to offer insights, suggestions, and resources to support the user's mental well-being.

## Tech Stack
