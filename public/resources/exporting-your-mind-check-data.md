# Exporting Your Mind Check Data

## Introduction

Mind Check understands the importance of having control over your mental health data. We provide a convenient way for you to export your data in various formats, empowering you to keep track of your mental well-being journey.

## Export Options

Mind Check offers three export formats: CSV, JSON, and XML. Each format serves a unique purpose, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs.

### CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

CSV is a versatile format suitable for viewing data in spreadsheet software. When you choose CSV, Mind Check provides two files for download: one for scores and another for journals.

#### Scores CSV File

The Scores CSV file includes the following headers:

- S.No.
- Test Taken
- ... (Individual questions about feelings, thoughts, and behaviors)
- Calculated Score

#### Journals CSV File

The Journals CSV file includes the following headers:

- S.No.
- Test Taken
- Type (Mood or Journal)
- Entry

### JSON and XML

JSON and XML are structured data formats that include both scores and journal entries. These formats are ideal for users who want a comprehensive view of their data in a machine-readable format.

## Export Limits

It's important to note that there are export limits to ensure responsible use of this feature. Each user is allowed three downloads per day for each category (CSV, JSON, and XML).

### Current Download Limits
