# Exporting Your Mind Check Data

## Introduction

Mind Check understands the importance of having control over your mental health data. We provide a convenient way for you to export your data in various formats, empowering you to keep track of your mental well-being journey.

## Export Options

Mind Check offers three export formats: CSV, JSON, and XML. Each format serves a unique purpose, allowing you to choose the one that best fits your needs.

### CSV (Comma-Separated Values)

CSV is a versatile format suitable for viewing data in spreadsheet software. When you choose CSV, Mind Check provides two files for download: one for scores and another for journals.

#### Scores CSV File

The Scores CSV file includes the following headers:

- S.No.
- Test Taken
- ... (Individual questions about feelings, thoughts, and behaviors)
- Calculated Score

#### Journals CSV File

The Journals CSV file includes the following headers:

- S.No.

### JSON and XML

JSON and XML are structured data formats that include both scores and journal entries. These formats are ideal for users who want a comprehensive view of their data in a machine-readable format.
