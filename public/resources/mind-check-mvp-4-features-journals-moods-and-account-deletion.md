# Mind Check MVP 4 Features: Journals, Moods, and Account Deletion

## Introduction

Mind Check is excited to unveil its latest features in MVP 4, designed to provide users with even more control over their mental well-being journey. In this update, we're introducing Journal Entries, Mood Tracking, and the ability to Delete Your Account. Let's explore these features in detail.

## 1. **Journal Entries**

Journal entries are a powerful way to reflect on your day, capture your thoughts, and track your emotions. In Mind Check MVP 4, we've introduced two types of entries: Moods and Journals.

### **Moods**

Express your emotions using a range of moods, each represented by an emoji. From "Devastated" to "Blissful," choose the mood that best reflects your state of mind.

### **Journals**

Record your thoughts, experiences, and feelings through text entries. Journals are split into Moods and Text inputs, providing you with a holistic view of your daily emotional journey.

Please note that entries are editable only for the day they are made. Past entries cannot be modified, preserving the authenticity of your emotional reflections.

## 2. **Mood and Journal Editing**

Editing is limited to the day of entry. This ensures that your reflections remain true to the moment and prevents altering emotions retroactively. Your past self is a valuable record of growth and change.

## 3. **Delete Your Account**

### âš  Danger Zone: Deleting Your Account

Deleting your account is a significant decision, and we want you to be fully informed before proceeding.

**Warning: This action is irreversible.**

By deleting your account, you permanently remove all data associated with it, including test history, journal entries, and profile information. This action cannot be undone.

### How to Delete Your Account

If you're sure you want to proceed:

1. Type the following text: "delete my account."
2. Click on the "Delete Account" button.

By confirming this action, you acknowledge that all your data will be permanently deleted.

If you have any concerns or would like to export your data before deleting your account, please [contact](https://twitter.com/_kunalkeshan_) our support team.
