# Feeling like a failure

I don’t have a job right now

I haven’t really made any friends

Imagine this:

What if success was guaranteed?

The catch is:

It takes time

It takes effort

It does not go smoothly along the way

It does not go as fast as we want

It does not go as easily as we want

Try an experiment where you play a little mental game where you imagine wild success:

What if all your hard work paid off?

What if you got your dream job?

What if you connected with a group of great new friends?

The only thing right now between you & that vision of success is persistence. Or in today's terminology, "grit":

The way I picture success (i.e. achieving what you want) is as an island in the middle of a pond. To get there, there are two types of stepping stones to help us walk towards our goal:

Right stones, which represent successful steps

Left stones, which represent failure experiences

It's important to realize a few things here:

Failure does not meaning failing

Failing means quitting. That's when we stop making progress on our journey!

Failure is required to achieve success, because (1) nobody learns perfectly, and (2) it's hard to know how to do things right when you don't know how to do things wrong!

Failure tends to feel pretty bad for us, so we have to practicing choosing to decouple how we feel from what we let dictate our behavior!

Sometimes we have to go through a few learning experiences to figure out what we really want & to get ourselves in a better position! For example, I spent some time working in corporate America before discovering that I really prefer the flexibility of freelancing in my career field! It took a number of years, bad bosses & bad positions to help me figure out what I really wanted! The approach I take is like this:

**Perfection**: Ideally, everything would just go smoothly, on-time, on-track, and go the way we want it to go. But it's impossible to control all of the conditions & it's really hard to just magically be "perfect" in our efforts!

**Progress**: We can also tie our identities to making progress, but man, that's hard to do too, especially when things go SLOW &

**Process**: This is basically being willing to make & use checklists & then stick with things, so that even when we fall off the wagon or get disheartened, we can soldier on & be persistent in our efforts & be patient in waiting for things to improve!

In the 3-act structure of a story, there's a beginning, a middle, and an end. Right now, you're at the part of the hero's journey where the hero is having a hard time & is experiencing doubts. The thing to remember is that persistence is really the primary key to success, because as long as we keep trying, we'll get there, but if we quit before we achieve our goals (even if it's hard & even if it takes a really long time!), say of making new friends or landing a job we really love, then we miss out on finishing walking across those stepping stones of successful steps & failure experiences to get to the Island of Success!

As far as friends go, you can be the sweetest peach in the orchard, but some people simply don't like peaches! This can be doubly hard when we're experiencing self-doubt & low self-esteem, because then the bad feelings & the anxiety kicks in, which makes it even harder to interact with people. Here are a few things to consider:

What type of social relationship are you looking for? Do you want a best friend to hang out with? A group of friends? Niche-specific friends, like a local sports group or D&D gaming group? Do you like to go out to do random things like hiking, bowling, or going out to eat?

People generally respond to how they're treated first: how are you presenting yourself to the world? Are you willing to be the kind of person who approaches people first & makes them feel comfortable & listens to what they have to say about their interests? Are you willing to handle rejection & keep trying with other people, despite the negative emotions we have to sometimes deal with, because not everyone is interested in what we're interested in or in us

Consider joining in-person & online social groups. That could be taking a dance class or going to a paint night or participating in a trivia night at a local restaurant. As far as online activities go, reddit & Facebook have some really great niche communities as well, which don't replace actual live human interaction, but like, I have a really busy work schedule with odd hours because I'm always on-call, so I can still dive into different cooking groups, 3D printing groups, etc. & chat with people about projects, techniques, cool new stuff coming out, etc.

## It mostly boils down to managing your personal boundaries

Sometimes your journey in life isn't going to feel great; are you willing to be persistent & stick with putting in the effort over time despite that? Which, by the way, is exactly what you're doing right now by working through your mental block of applying to places, even if it's not as fast as easy or you want, so good job on that front!!

What exactly DOES success mean to you? What does that dream job look like? What do those friendships look like? Keep in mind that 85% of people hate their jobs, so a lot of people are willing to settle for something they're not happy with & eventually quit trying for more, which is why defining & enforcing our personal boundaries in different situations in our life is so important!

Rather than being purely reactive, are you willing to be proactive & become the type of person who doesn't settle for less than the job they want, and who becomes the type of person that the friends you're looking for would want to be friends with? This was a big deal for me because my social life improved quite a bit once I learned how to engage in small-talk & started approaching people & testing the waters, because I didn't do ANY of that before due to massive personal anxiety, haha!

### Anyway, to recap

- What is success was guaranteed?
- What does WILD SUCCESS look like to you, both in your career & in your social life?
- What can YOU do to be proactive about taking actionable steps to move towards your vision of success in life?

Right now, you're doing great! You've done the first two steps already:

You've created your initial two goals (you want to have a job & you want to have friends)

Despite the difficulty you're encountering, you've been applying to new jobs every couple of weeks, so I'm proud of you!

I was essentially a hermit growing up in grade school. Huge, massive anxiety, struggling with a poor work ethic due to health issues & undiagnosed ADHD, and generally just didn't have a really good time in life. Fast-forward a few decades of sticking with it, and I have a really great job with some really terrific friends! It wasn't easy or quick to get here because things like socializing & personal productivity didn't come naturally to me, but again, persistence is key! If we don't quit, we'll get there! Good luck!!
