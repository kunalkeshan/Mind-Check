Hey there! It's fantastic to see your commitment to self-improvement and your willingness to share your thoughts. As someone a few years ahead on this journey, let me offer you some invaluable advice that has shaped my own growth[^1]:

- **Focus on ONE thing at a time**. Most people in this space get extremely motivated and try to form lots of good habits all at once and become burnt out. Instead, try to focus on instituting ONE good habit at a time.

- **Learn to not give in to what people think**. Are your hairlines receding? Good, you're a man. You messaged a girl after she ghosted you? Good, it shows that you would be committed to a relationship. Now you can find someone better. These are just examples but you take my point.

- **Don't dwell on the past**. You've mentioned this in your post already. But really, learn to follow your own advice. Dwelling on the past means you're not living in the present and is a pathway to depression.

- **Finally, -and this is the most important one imo-, be kind to yourself**. Many people at your point become extremely disciplined and tough on themselves and focus on always improving, which is great. However, don't become obsessed with being hard on yourself. Take a look around every once in a while and be grateful and proud for how far you've come.
