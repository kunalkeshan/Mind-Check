**Here's a closer look at some of the key features Mind Check offers:**

## Free Test and Feedback

Mind Check provides a collection of mental health tests that users can take for free. These tests are designed to evaluate various aspects of mental well-being, including thoughts and feelings, activities and personal relationships, physical symptoms, and suicidal urges. After completing a test, users receive personalized feedback based on their responses. This feedback helps users gain insights into their mental state, providing them with a starting point for self-reflection and further action.

## User Accounts

Mind Check offers the option for users to create an account, which unlocks additional features and benefits. By creating an account, users can store their test data securely and access it anytime, anywhere. This allows them to track their progress over time, observe patterns in their mental well-being, and gain a deeper understanding of their journey towards improved mental health. User accounts also enable users to receive personalized recommendations for improving their mental well-being based on their test results and history.

## Secure Data Storage

At Mind Check, we understand the importance of privacy and data security. That's why we utilize Firebase, a trusted cloud-based platform, for secure data storage and authentication. User data, including test results and personal information, is encrypted and protected, ensuring confidentiality and peace of mind.

## Evidence-Based Approach

Mind Check employs the Burns Depression Checklist, a widely recognized and validated assessment tool, to calculate the user's score. This checklist provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the severity of depressive symptoms. By leveraging this evidence-based approach, Mind Check ensures accuracy and reliability in assessing mental well-being.
