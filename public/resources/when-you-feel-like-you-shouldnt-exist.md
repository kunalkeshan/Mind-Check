When I became too caught up with my inner angst I decided to make time to do volunteer work at a social service nonprofit to help organize a basketball tournament for kids.

Focusing my attention and energy to make someone else's life better made the majority of my depression fade away. Putting someone else's life ahead of yours gives you a purpose to live.

Valuing your own happiness during times of depression can actually have the opposite effect. Whether it's a nonprofit, troubled family member, senior housing, disadvantaged teenagers, math tutoring, homeless, or medical research there are plenty of people that would value your help and your life even if you don't value your life yourself.

Making someone else's life better is infectious and I know you are capable of doing just that. The world needs you more than you think.
