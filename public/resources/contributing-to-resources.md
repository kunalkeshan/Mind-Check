   - This is to ensure that the content reflects on the platform when a user is looking for it.
   - Also, ensure to place a proper title, the name of the markdown file, and associated tags for the same.

It should be in the following format.

```ts
{
    title: 'Title of the post',
    description: "A short  description",
    tags: ['General'], // 'Thoughts & Feelings', 'Activities & Personal Relationships', 'Physical Symptoms', 'Suicidal Urges'
