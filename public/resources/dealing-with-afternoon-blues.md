Question taken from LPT sub on reddit.[^1]

Walk for 10-20 minutes After Eating[^2]

Explanation: After eating, your body is still digesting the food for the upcoming 2-3 hours. So, your 'fasted state' doesn't start at the time you stop eating, it starts later. A fasted state, depending on your goals, can help you focus more, sleep better, or exercise more efficiently.

The walk helps you accelerate that transition into a fasted state. It increases gastric emptying time and maintains a healthy blood glucose level. So you also avoid the crashes you get after large meals.

How to do it: If you just want to maintain high energy and/or avoid the 1-4 PM crash, then take a walk after your next meal. If you like to fast, then take a walk after dinner.

To remember, maybe add it to your to-do list or schedule a reminder. Or do it right after breakfast and get that morning sun ☀️!
​Note that you can do any form of light exercise, not just walking.

I’ll flip this question on its head. Here are some big things I’ve found that always made the afternoon crash WORSE:[^3]

- Napping for longer than 20 minutes
- Eating a heavy lunch
- Skipping lunch
- Not taking a lunch break
- Taking too long of a lunch break
- Using any type of social media / videogames on your lunch break (HUGE!!)
